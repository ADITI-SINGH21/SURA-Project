### Modelling &amp; In-Vitro Experimentation of Drug Delivery System (Simulation Part)
This repository consists of all the simulation part which was used in the project.<br/>
Below is the summary of project- <br />
• Analysed non-Darcy flow of blood in tumours by Monte Carlo simulations on C++ with random and non-random resistances in it.<br/>
• Worked on optimal pressure to be applied implementing the Djisktra Algorithm for intra-tumoral drug delivery system.<br/>
• Obtained the python plots of Average Fraction of Open Nodes v/s Applied Pressure for different Sizes of 2D and 3D grid.<br/>
• Modelled the extra-cellular matrix of tissues using hydrogel and studied the diffusion rate of methyl red through the gel.<br/>
• Recorded the process, made the image sequence & processed them using ImageJ software.<br/>
